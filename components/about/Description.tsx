          Hello! I&apos;m <span className="font-bold">Gustavo Couti√±o</span>, a
          computer science student passionate about creating impactful digital
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in web development, with expertise in Javascript, React,
          and Tailwind CSS. Currently, I&apos;m expanding my skills into backend
          technologies, exploring Go and microservices architecture to build
          more robust and scalable applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond web development, I participate in competitive programming
          challenges. I&apos;ve represented my school in the International
          Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) and advanced to the national
          level competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to collaborate with forward-thinking teams and individuals
          to create applications that positively impact thousands of lives. I
          believe technology should be accessible, efficient, and solve
          real-world problems.
