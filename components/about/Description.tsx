          Hello! I'm <span className="font-bold">Gustavo Couti√±o</span>, a
          computer science student passionate about creating impactful digital
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in web development, with expertise in Javascript, React,
          and Tailwind CSS. Currently, I'm expanding my skills into backend
          technologies, exploring Go and microservices architecture to build
          more robust and scalable applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond web development, I participate in competitive programming
          challenges. I've represented my school in the International Collegiate
          Programming Contest (ICPC) and advanced to the national level
          competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to collaborate with forward-thinking teams and individuals
          to create applications that positively impact thousands of lives. I
          believe technology should be accessible, efficient, and solve
          real-world problems.
